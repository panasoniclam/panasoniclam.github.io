Here are several books I've read so far

### 1. Product

- [Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers](https://amzn.to/38dvcne), by John Wiley and Sons. It's critical to understand how business works, esp. for technological companies. This book opens my eyes in business & strategy. I also use these knowledges to build my organizations. 

- [The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses](https://amzn.to/2H2ZJbp), by Eric Ries. Startups must find markets to validate their MVP (Minimum Viable Products) first. It's a continuous cycle of Build-Measure-Learn. A good read for any going-to-be techpreneurs.

- [Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321965515/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bigsonata0b-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0321965515&linkId=fa2fbdacca85dd150ad0885eb605815d), by Steve Krug. For me, this is a must-read book for any one new to Web design. It contains several patterns in Web which are visualized & annotated for any one to follow easily.

- [The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing](https://amzn.to/2SwthDX), by Al Ries, Jack Troutâ€Ž. To build good products, you must know how to do marketing from day one. It's interesting to see some common patterns in this area.

### 2. Technology

### 3. Profession

- [The Effective Engineer: How to Leverage Your Efforts In Software Engineering to Make a Disproportionate and Meaningful Impact](https://amzn.to/38cdnFj), by Edmond Lau. A computer science degree teaches you how software works, but it does NOT let you know how to be an excellent engineers. Practice makes perfect. I'm impressed with Edmon writing about ways to be effective in engineering. There are several lessons you can apply at personal or team levels.

### 4. Management

- [An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://amzn.to/2Uzsg0n), by Will Larson. Will has been an engineering leader at Digg, Uber, Stripe, and, as of 2020, Calm. In this book, Will share many precious experience in building an efficient engineering organizations.

- [Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility](https://amzn.to/2tIOMce), by Patty McCord. I was first introduced to [Netflix Culture Decks](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/2-Netflix_CultureFreedom_Responsibility2) by Reed Hastings, co-founder & CEO of Netflix. The deck describes an inspirational & novel approach in building last-long organizations. This book of Patty, Reed's co-founder sheds some stories behind the deck and how Netflix internally works.
