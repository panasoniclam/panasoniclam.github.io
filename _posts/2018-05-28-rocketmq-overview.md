Apache RocketMQ is an interesting message broker. This [article](https://www.infoq.com/articles/alibaba-apache-rocketmq) told a good story about the broker:

> + From Alibaba to Apache, RocketMQ has evolved through three generations.
> + RocketMQ, as a high throughput, high reliability, and low latency distributed MOM, consists of four parts: Name Servers, Brokers, Producers and Consumers.
> + During the 2016 global Nov. 11 Shopping Festival, RocketMQ has handled 1.2 trillion message transmissions, almost twice as much as of 2015.

But is the open-sourced version of Apache RocketMQ ready for production? Have a look at this presentation to find your own answer:
