### Welcome to Anh Le on the Web

This is a personal website where I can share my random thoughts about life, technologies & coding.

Just as a reference, I do have an existing weblog on [Wordpress](https://bigsonata.wordpress.com/). Technically, as a developer, I don't like to use Wordpress for blogging.  I want a more simple one. Jekyll with supports for Markdown is a great relief. Using it along with Github Page & CloudFlare makes blogging easily and free (you don't have to pay money).

In the recent future, I'll migrate several useful posts from the weblog to this new platform.

Thanks for reading!
